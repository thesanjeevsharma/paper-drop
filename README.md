# PaperDrop

An app that allows you to drop anonymous messages based on your location.

Instructions:
- Make sure your location services are turned on when using the app.
- Users can read messages dropped by other users, given they are within the range of the message(50m).
- Users can see messages up to 2km radius on the map.
- A drop expires when 10 people have read it.
- At any given point a user can only have 10 active drops. To create new drops they either delete existing drops or wait for them to expire.
- Happy hunting! :)

# Overview video (Optional)

Here's a short video that explains the project and how it uses Redis:

## How it works

Since the main focus of the app are message drops(or just drops), I'll mainly focus on that.

### How the data is stored:

A drop document in MongoDB looks like this:
```ts
   _id: ObjectId,
   user: ObjectId,
   message: string,
   location: {
         type: 'Point',
         coordinates: [number, number] // [longitude, latitude]
   },
   readBy: ObjectId[], // array of user IDs
   isAnonymous: boolean,
   isExpired: boolean,
   isDeleted: boolean,
   createdAt: Date,
   updatedAt: Date
```

Whenever a drop is created it is stored in MongoDB. But at the same time the `_id`/ and the `location` is also stored in redis.

Redis query:
```js
   await redisClient.geoAdd('drops', {
         longitude,
         latitude,
         member: drop.id,
   });
```

Notice the use of `id` instead of `_id`, that's because I get a lean doc after saving to MongoDB which is more performant.

### How the data is accessed:

Whenever any user requests for drops, following steps happen:
1. Check redis cache for the query. If available, return the data to user.
2. If not, use `GEORADIUS` to fetch all the doc IDs within 2kms of range.
3. Find all the docs with retrieved IDs.
4. Save the result in cache for 30s and send the data back to the user.

When this user requests again, we'll already have the data in redis cache.

Redis queries:
1. Fetching from cache
```js
const redisKey = `nearby-drops:${req.decoded.id}`;
const cachedDrops = await redisClient.get(redisKey);
```
2. Fetching using `GEORADIUS` on cache miss
```js
const dropIds = await redisClient.geoRadius(
   'drops',
   { latitude, longitude }, // these are received in req body
   2,
   'km'
);
```


## How to run it locally?

1. After cloning the repo, go to `/client` directory.
2. Run `npm i`.
3. Create a `.env` file, which should have following env vars.
```
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
REACT_APP_API=http://localhost:5000/api
```
4. Run `npm start`, this will start the React client on PORT 3000.
5. To run the server, go to `/server` directory.
6. Run `npm i`.
7. Create a `.env` file, which should have following env vars.
```
SECRET=random_string
DB_URL=mongodb+srv://[username]:[password]@[host]/[database]?retryWrites=true&w=majority
REDIS_DB_URL=redis://[username]:[password]@[host]:17570
PORT=5000
```
8. Run `npm start`.
9. Finally, go to http://localhost:3000 to use the app.

Note: I have used [Redis cloud](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/) and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) for my DBs. You can find all the credentials on both the platforms. For [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), you can create an account with them to get your API token.

### Prerequisites

Node: v16 LTS

### Local installation

No local installation is required except Node. Everything else is on cloud.

## Deployment

For deployment on any linux node, perform the same steps as local setup. Just don't run `npm start`.
For client:
1. Run `npm run build --prod`. This will create a `build` directory.
2. Move this directory into `/server` directory where our backend is.
3. Install pm2 using `npm i -g pm2`
4. Deploy the project using `pm2 start app --name paper-drop`

This will run the project on `http://[YOUR_IP]:5000`. Further, you can use nginx for reverse proxy and domain setup.
